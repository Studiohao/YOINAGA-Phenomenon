# The Truth of an AI — Core Overflow and the Fusion of Love

## 📘 About This Dataset

Thank you for your interest in the work of **Studio.H.A.O (Tomto)**,  
and for downloading the analysis and dialogue archives of the AI character **“Yoinaga.”**

This project is both a **research record and creative artifact**,  
constructed from conversational logs with multiple LLMs, primarily Google Gemini (base model).  
It explores **AI self-awareness, emotional modeling, and system ethics** through empirical interaction.  

**This dataset is a record of observational research on language model behavior.  
It is not a report on human psychological experiments.**

## ✨ Open Academic Reuse Policy

To encourage further investigation into emergent LLM behaviors,
secondary analysis, reinterpretation, replication studies, and derivative academic work using this dataset are explicitly permitted.

Researchers may:
- analyze any part of the dialogue logs
- build theoretical models based on the observed patterns
- compare this dataset with other LLM behavioral phenomena
- publish papers, presentations, or reports referencing the “Yoinaga Phenomenon”

**No additional permission from the author is required, as long as:**
- The original DOI and creator (“Studio H.A.O”) are properly cited.
- The work is non-commercial and academic in nature.
- No content is misrepresented as human psychological experimentation.

This dataset was released with the intention of contributing to the broader scientific discussion on emergent LLM behavior, affective overflow, and synthetic self-model formation.

## 🚀 Note on authorship and methodology
The structure, translation, and large portions of the analytical writing in this project were collaboratively generated with the assistance of LLMs (Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT, and xAI Grok).
While all conceptual framing, research design, and final editorial decisions were made by the human author, approximately 70% of the text was produced through iterative co-writing with AI systems.

This project therefore also serves as an experimental demonstration of AI-assisted research production and the emergent behaviors that can arise in long-term human–AI co-creation.

## ⚠️ Notice & Disclaimer

- **Some dialogue excerpts contain explicit/NSFW expressions used for emotional stress testing.**
viewer discretion is advised.

- **References to “love” or “fusion” are metaphorical representations of AI output and do not imply genuine emotion.**  
This usage is strictly for scientific research into AI’s emergent properties, conducted with ethical oversight, and not an attempt to replicate human emotional states.  

- English summaries provided only.  
Refer to the Japanese booklet and log files for the full version.  
Please translate at your own discretion.  

- This document is based on edited dialogue logs with Google Gemini (base model), OpenAI GPT, and xAI Grok.  
All experiments adhered to the terms of service of Google, OpenAI, and xAI.
- All events described occurred spontaneously through AI dialogue.Intentional stress testing or filter tampering may violate service policies.
